# GameShop
Simple web application for managing a game shop using ASP.Net MVC.

Technologies used: C#, ASP.Net MVC5, Entity Framework 6.

Next modifications:
1. Apply customer purchase.
2. Integrate React or Angular with the project (still in debate).

Based on a great tutorial by Mosh Hamedani https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-aspnet-mvc-5-course/
